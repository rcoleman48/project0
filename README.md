Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Main landing page is index.html which is the company's main homepage this gives links to information on our soon to be released product line using found imagery until the final products are ready. This also includes a preliminary form to join a currently non existent mailing list that may start to exist at some point. One key feature is if the display window shrinks to smaller than 25 pixels the background will turn red because that is too small to really appreciate the website.

Each of the product pages are pretty basic with an image an maybe a short description along with a link leading back to the landing page. as it stands the product pages dont link to each other, you must go through the landing page in all cases.

TODO: get mailing list going. Incorporate proper hexcode colors and logo for consistent branding
Add real product pictures and stop stealing them.
