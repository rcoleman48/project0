			Kimchi is a korean fermented cabbage akin to saurkraut. In this case, however, the cabbage is generally nappa cabbage and fermented with korean chili flakes, gochugaru, along with ginger, garlic, and any other seasonings desired. The cabage is fermented in a 2% by mass salt solution. This is left to ferment for 7-14 days until desired flavor and texture is reached. Pairs great with beef, or goes great in a grilled cheese.
