			Apple Cider vinegar is produced when the alcohols and other sugars are converted into acetic acid. so starting from fresh apples first apple cider must be made by pitching apples with saison yeast or other brewers yeast and then fermented for 2 weeks. The cider can then be pressed out of the apples and collected. Other unpasteurized vinegar must be added as backslop, using 20% by mass will seed the formation of acetic acid. The process is accelerated by using an aquarium bubbler to aerate the vinegar.
